## Introduction üí•

D-Bug brings out a unique opportunity for Student Developers to find Bugs in the existing Code and fix them, while moving ahead in a linear series of challenges in various languages. The Repository consists of buggy codes and the Contributors are tasked to fix them up by either fixing the Syntax or the Code Logic. 

We currently have 20 Problems in `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `Golang`, and `Python` and each problem has a corresponding `README` file which describes the Problem and the Test-Cases associated with it, which you need to solve and move ahead. 

## Motivation üëÄ

As Developers, we often need to capitalize on our skills to read through the Code and find Errors that might have occured either due to the lack of Syntax Knowledge or the proper Thought Process. Through these Exercises, we aim you to exercise your Brain Cells, and get better in the following: 

- Code Reading
- Code Debugging
- Finding Bug Fixes on Google/Stack Overflow
- Fixing Bugs on your Own 
- Understanding Code Logic 

The Problems are divided into three sub-categories: `Easy`, `Medium` and `Hard` and we expect you to go over these Problems and fix these issues while making personal notes in your individual Forks on how did you solve them. 

## Best Practices ‚úî

We expect you to follow some Best Practices while you fix these Bugs and make some Open-Source Contribution on the way. These Best Practices include: 

- Time-Boxing each Exercise according to the Difficulty Level.
- Working on Branches rather than the Main Branch. 
- Adding specific Notes in the `README` on how did you solve the Bug. 
- Making proper Commit Messages. 
- Not changing entire Code but finding the specific Bug and solving it out.
